1. Comments display layout not proper - height of comment is not auto, it is static
2. Routing across menu duplicates its content, not hiding - HAPPENS ON APP ERROR
3. Form validation - FIXED
4. URL filter not working: http://localhost:3000/dishes?featured=true - FIXED    
5. Form reset after submit in dish comment - still showing error after clearing
